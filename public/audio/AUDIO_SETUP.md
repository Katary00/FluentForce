# Audio Test Files

Since we can't generate actual audio files programmatically, you'll need to:

1. Create or record audio files for each question
2. Name them as follows:
   - question1.mp3 (Academic Methodology Lecture)
   - question2.mp3 (Peer Review Process) 
   - question3.mp3 (Academic Writing Structure)

3. Place them in this folder: public/audio/

## Alternative for Testing:
You can use any audio files you have and rename them to question1.mp3, question2.mp3, question3.mp3 for immediate testing of the audio functionality.

## Expected Behavior:
- Play/Pause button controls audio playback
- Skip Forward button advances audio by 10 seconds
- Mute/Unmute button toggles audio volume
- Progress bar shows real-time audio progress
- Time display shows current time / total duration
- Audio automatically resets when moving to next question
